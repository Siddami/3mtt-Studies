## Lessons Learned

While building this assignment, I learned how to effectively use conditional statements to determine user status based on age and to handle various weather conditions. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring the logic flowed correctly to cover all scenarios. I overcame this by breaking down each condition and testing my code incrementally to ensure accurate outputs.

## Appendix

This assignment consists of two parts:
1. **Assignment 1 (If-Else)**: Determines if a person is a student based on their age and class level.
2. **Assignment 2 (Switch)**: Suggests activities based on the current weather.
