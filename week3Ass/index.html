        <h1>Week 3 Assignment</h1>
        <h2>By Abdulkareem Yetunde Siddiqat: Fellow ID(FE/23/5716698)</h2>
        <p>My <strong>3MTT frontend journey</strong> has been an incredible experience of growth and learning. I began by diving into weekly modules that challenged my understanding of software development and the <em>software development lifecycle (SDLC)</em>. The hands-on assignments, including building an <em>eCommerce landing page</em>, helped me refresh my HTML and CSS skills while exploring responsive design principles. Connecting with my classmates and receiving guidance from my <strong>detailed mentors</strong> has made this journey not only educational but also <strong>inspiring</strong>. I'm excited to continue pushing my boundaries and enhancing my skills in frontend development!</p>
